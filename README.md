# Yiddish-Modified-QWERTY-Keyboard-for-Mac

Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/vatnid/yiddish-keyboard">vatnid</a> for the Yiddish Klal keyboard for MacOS, because I got the raw files from there. 

This keyboard is the same as my Yiddish Modified QWERTY Keyboard for Windows 10/11, or YiddishQ for short. This keyboard was made in Windows and I have no way to test it, so hopefully this works and apologies if it doesn't.

This keyboard is a phonetic keyboard for Yiddish based off the US English QWERTY keyboard and Isaac Bleaman's Yiddish Klal keyboard for Mac, with some modifications that are mildly intuitive to me, with the principle that common letters should be easily typeable and the Shift key should modify letters or give Hebrew equivalents.

This keyboard is mainly based on Yiddish Klal, with precomposed characters available at the same key positions when pressing the ⌥ option key.
Most letters are phonetically equivalent, with exceptions including:
<ul>
  <li>q for א</li>
  <li>w for ש</li>
  <li>x for כ</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

Shift + [key] includes these results:
<ul>
  <li>Q for טש</li>
  <li>W for שׂ</li>
  <li>X for ך</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

## Installation
Copy both YiddishQ.keylayout and YiddishQ.icns to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts.
